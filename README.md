Arcade Game Project
===============================

This project involved using Object Oriented Javascript and HTML5 canvas to create a simple frogger game. The game engine and artwork were provided by Udacity, and app.js contains the OOJ code I wrote.

This project includes Javascript object.prototype for inheritance, switch statements, for loops, and if/else statements. Several classes were built for this game, including a player class, which includes an update function that moves the players around the HTML5 canvas, a function that keeps the player inside the HTML5 canvas, and a reset function as well when the player reaches the water. I also made an emeny class, which moved the enemy bugs across the board at random speeds.



Bugger
===============================

1. Object

The goal of this game is to move the player safely across
the land to reach the water. The enemy bugs are out to get you and they will
spawn at random speeds and locations each time. When a player safely reaches
the water, the game will restart.

2. Instructions

To start the game, simply load the index.html file.

3. Controls

The controls for the game are simple: Just use your up, down, left, and right
arrow keys to navigate your player around the map.
